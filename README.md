# Find the [Spring to Life (1.21.5) update here](https://modrinth.com/mod/perfect-parity-1-21-5)!

## Don't Wait

I was sick of Mojang changing and breaking so many mods every update. I wanted to play with my modpack but didn't want to wait for the new features.  
So this mod asks: **"Why not both?"**

Unlike many backport mods, this does **not** aim to backport between *major* versions (e.g., 1.21 → 1.20).  
Instead, it's a **minor version backport mod** — most mods I personally use are on 1.21.1 or 1.21.4. I don’t think it’s fair to choose between new features and mod compatibility.
